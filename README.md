## What is map generation ?
Map generation is a powerful technique used in many games to create map or parts of a map with algorithms. The method of creating data from algorithms is named [procedural generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation). It has been used in a lot of games, like The Elder Scrolls (most of them), Age of Empire, The Binding of Isaac, No Man's Sky, or the well known Minecraft.
